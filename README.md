# FX for Bea

*Microapp for my friend, an accountant.*

Requirements were to find **daily**, **monthly** and **spot** (last day of month) FX rates for selected currencies.

Some currencies are to be found on [ECB](ecbapi), but rest must come from elsewhere, because they not listed on ECB unfortunatelly. Those I found on [Apilayer exchange rates API](apilayerapi) & investing.com (using [investiny](investiny)).

To access Apilayer API, one must register to obtain API key.
